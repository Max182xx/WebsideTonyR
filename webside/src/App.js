       <p>  Chuck Norris beats rock, paper, scissors. Cannon balls, tanks, super destroyers, exploding stars — I could go on. When Chuck Norris writes, he makes paper bleed. If it looks like chicken, tastes like chicken, and feels like chicken but Chuck Norris says its beef, then it’s beef. If Chuck Norris were to travel to an alternate dimension in which there was another Chuck Norris and they both fought, they would both win. Chuck Norris drinks napalm to fight his heartburn.
Chuck Norris has never blinked in his entire life. Never. The Great Wall of China was originally created to keep Chuck Norris out. It didn’t work. Chuck Norris used to beat the shit out of his shadow because it was following to close. It now stands a safe 30 feet behind him. When Chuck Norris gives you the finger, he’s telling you how many seconds you have left to live. Chuck Norris’ tears cure cancer. Too bad he has never cried.

Chuck Norris used to beat the shit out of his shadow because it was following to close. It now stands a safe 30 feet behind him. Chuck Norris once shattered the space-time continuum. He felt so bad, he put it back together. Chuck Norris can slam revolving doors. Chuck Norris’ cowboy boots are made from real cowboys. Chuck Norris can kill two stones with one bird.

The Great Wall of China was originally created to keep Chuck Norris out. It didn’t work. Chuck Norris tells Simon what to do. Chuck Norris can sit in the corner of a round room. Chuck Norris can play the violin with a piano. Chuck Norris can dribble a bowling ball.
